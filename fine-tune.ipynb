FAYEMI KAYODE congratulations in advance as governor elect of ekiti state. Go to court over an inconsequential white paper? Abeg shift one side. The supreme court already settled this matter in 2007 when Obasanjo wanted to use the white paper of an administrative panel of inquiry to stop Atiku and some other politicians from contesting then. Only a court of competent jurisdiction can bar a qualified Nigerian from contesting or holding public office. This is just an empty order similar to the one done by Wike against Amaechi in Rivers state. 122 Likes 4 SharesRe Ekiti Bars Fayemi, Other From Holding Public Offices In State by potent5m 517pm On Jan 15, 2018 Good move by Fayose. 10 Likes 1 ShareRe Ekiti Bars Fayemi, Other From Holding Public Offices In State by Adekdammy 539pm On Jan 15, 2018 in as much as am not a fan of Fayemi, Fayose has gotten this wrong, tell me what is the difference between Fayose and Fayemi when it comes to mismanagement? 9 Likes Re Ekiti Bars Fayemi, Other From Holding Public Offices In State by Nobody 546pm On Jan 15, 2018 Adekdammyin as much as am not a fan of Fayemi, Fayose has gotten this wrong, tell me what is the difference between Fayose and Fayemi when it comes to mismanagement?Ose and Emi is the difference when it comes to mismanagement. 17 Likes Re Ekiti Bars Fayemi, Other From Holding Public Offices In State by Sealeddealm 552pm On Jan 15, 2018 Such order will not stand. 4 Likes Re Ekiti Bars Fayemi, Other From Holding Public Offices In State by Geofavorm 614pm On Jan 15, 2018 ...Re Ekiti Bars Fayemi, Other From Holding Public Offices In State by oyetunderm 614pm On Jan 15, 2018 Ekiti?
